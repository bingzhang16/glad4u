#Gene List Automatically Derived For You (GLAD4U)

The goal of Gene List Automatically Derived For You (GLAD4U) is to implement an algorithm searching the scientific literature (Pubmed) to retrieve the list of publications corresponding to a userâ€™s query. The algorithm will then translate the list of publications into a list of genes referenced in these publications. The last step is to present the user with the list of prioritized genes, from the most to the least referenced genes within the search space.
